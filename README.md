## 🧬 Introduction

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a fast-progressing cancer that predominantly affects white blood cells. Early and precise detection is vital for effective treatment. This project automates the classification of blood smear images into normal or ALL-positive categories using state-of-the-art CNN models, offering a robust tool for the medical community.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project comprises meticulously labeled blood smear images, divided into normal and ALL-positive categories. Extensive pre-processing techniques were applied to enhance image quality and improve the model’s performance.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The project employs the following deep learning models to ensure a robust classification process:

- **ResNet-50**: A deep residual network renowned for its accuracy and capability to handle complex patterns.
- **EfficientNet-B3**: An optimized model balancing efficiency and performance, known for its scalable architecture.
- **AlexNet**: A pioneering architecture in the field of CNNs, known for its simplicity and effectiveness.
- **VGG16**: A classic model famous for its straightforward and deep architecture, delivering reliable results.

Each model was fine-tuned and trained using TensorFlow and Keras, with techniques like data augmentation and dropout to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization.
